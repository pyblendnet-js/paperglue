# paperglue
A sandbox template for use with paper.js and optionally node.js
## Introduction
paperglue.js is far from finished and will not be a complete version until it is used in an application.  It began life as the basis for a strip board circuit designer (inspired by [verodes] (http://www.heyrick.co.uk/software/verodes/) and similar programs). The first use will be as an editor for a flash style animation.  In last application, the actual animation code will reside in myScript.js and paperGlue.js will just be used to edit and load the design.
## Installation and Description
See the file paperglue.html file in this respository.
## Applications
Public applications using paperglue.html will be listed here when they exist.
