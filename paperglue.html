<h1>paperglue</h1>
A sandbox template for use with paper.js and optionally node.js
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>paperglue.js is far from finished and
  will not be a complete version until it is used in an application.
  It began life as the basis for a strip board circuit designer
  (inspired by <a href="http://www.heyrick.co.uk/software/verodes/">
  verodes</a> ( and similar programs).</p>
<p>The first use will be probably be as an editor for a flash style
  animation.
  In last application, the actual animation code will
  reside in myScript.js and paperGlue.js will just be used
  to edit and load the design.</p>
<h2>Installation and Description</h2>
<p>This document appears as paperglue.html file in this respository.</p>
<p>The example application can be launched from either home.html or
   using launcher.bat (under windows).</p>
<p>By opening home.html, the only restriction is the edited design
   can only be stored using local storage (which is browser dependant)
   or by listing in another tab and copying this page to file.</p>
<p>Using the launcher.bat assumed that you have
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> installed
   and then storage is available by default to and
   from a "project" subdirectory.  tghe launcher also opens your default
   browser (tested on firefox and chrome only) addressed to the local host
   on port 3000.  This could be edited in launcher.bat and server.js.</p>
<p>Alternative, edit the launcher.bat and add another argument after
   "node server.js" with either the relative or absolute path to the
   workspace.</p>
<p>Also in the base directory is dorec.js which is an example of a
   project record that can be loaded as a static source.</p>
<p>There are 4 javascript files in the js subdirectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>paper.js - which is a copy of the then current paper.js graphic library
  script available from <a href="paperjs.org">paperjs.org</a> - god bless em.</li>
<li>paperglue.js - a simple database to organise the editing of some simple
  paper.js objects and to load these as a doRecord from various sources including
  a node.js server.</li>
<li>nodecomms.js - the client interface to the node server.js if it is running.</li>
<li>myScript.js - the actual application where it all comes together to interface
with the html canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Public applications using paperglue.html will be listed here when they exist.
